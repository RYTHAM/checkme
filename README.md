Hi Bharti,

 

It was great
speaking with you. Here are the questions: 

 

Q) Tell us a bit about your childhood and early years-
where were you born and brought up and where did you study and what drew you to
technology? 

I was born
in sonepat Haryana, then moved to Gurgaon and dwarka delhi so studied in public
schools in the 3 cities. I was never into technology, I used to take dance and
arts as my elective subject in school. I am not a born techie, it was when I cleared
my 12 standard I got admitted to engineering college(Maharaja Surajmal Institue
of Technology). Having not good rank I was left with no choice but IT as the
stream for engineering and programming was a burden for me. For the first time
in my college I learnt the very basic hcf lcm program, and that small piece of
code made me realize how technology reduces human efforts, I mean finding LCM
of 1176, 3567, 1572 and what not was the most frustrating job to do even using
calculator. Automating stuff made me crazy and I jumped into the ocean of
technology and programming.

 

Q) What peaked your interest to study technology and
what kind of support did you receive from parents to pursue subjects of your
choice. 

As I
mentioned it was not a choice for me, it was just the last option left out,
either I have to go for IT engineering or drop for 1 year. I still remember
when I did not get good rank in the competitive exams, people told to my dad, that
why are you wasting money on her, those words hit me hard and I took it as a
challenge. Gradually I got interest in IT , I started enjoying every subject of
my graduation. I used to get 2nd or 3rd Rank in my
college , so I never got enough courage to call my parents on to the stage for
award ceremony, since it was not good enough. I took part in so many hackathons,
coding contest. One of my favorite is Google GDG Code Jam session on women’s
day in google office Gurgaon where I got 24 rank , For the first time I was
happy to have 2 digits rank J. 

After that I
kept on learning new technologies and different domains like data mining and
data science. I presented my research paper in ICRITO 2014   and it
is published in IEEE Xplore digital library ..url…. After my graduation I had
plenty of offer letters from companies like Infosys, LnT and Verizon But I
chose to Join Verizon so that I can come out of my comfort zone. I shifted to Hyderabad
on june 29 2015 and started working here. It was not easy to settle in totally
different place alone without parents. Gradually I realized that I am becoming
a 9 to 5 job holder and doing cultural activities, So to break the monotony and
bring in the adventure I took part in VDSI mega hackathon- challenge the
champions 2015 and I got special recognition and award from Verizon’x Ex MD Mr.
Santosh Bijur. 

Then again after
sometime I had the urge to learn something new, and I wrote INSOFE scholarship
exam and once again I punched above my weight and got 100% scholarship and I
graduated as big data analyst. 

But still
some where I felt incomplete, I had a dream since my childhood that I win some
competition and on the stage I tell it to everyone that I  am here because of my dad, he is the man
behind my success and my mother is my life support system in every ups and
downs. Luckily, I participated in techgig’s Geek Goddess competition and the
day of my life came. I felt like a celebrity after winning in all India coding
contest amongst 32k talented coders.  It
was a 45 day long competition, whose finale was held on 17th march
2017 and fortunately I was crowned as geek goddess 2017.

It was the
best feeling when pounding Heart that believed in my efforts won over the
pessimistic Brain. Competition and adrenaline has an addiction beyond anything
else. I strongly believe that continuous hard work, pinch of calm mindedness, be
fearless and the stage is yours. 

I also
believe that parents are living gods, so since their blessings were with me I
was able to achieve all this.

 

 

Q) What was the ratio of girls and boys in college- did
you have fewer girls? If yes, why? 

No we did
not have less girls in our college, there was a good ratio.

 

 

Q) Where are you working and tell us about your
role? 

I work as an
Analyst in Business Intelligence (data Science) team at Verizon data services
India Pvt Ltd . Before becoming CPEE graduate through insofe I was working as a
web API developer in which  used to code
java REST and SOAP APIs in specific.  Now
I work on machine learning and data engineering stuff using R language and
other analytics tools like SPSS, OBIEE etc.

 

Q) Your age? 

I am 23+

I completed my 23
years in October 2016.

Q) Is coding male dominated? Why is that the case
according to you? 

I never felt
that coding is male dominated , we should not measure it in quantity but
quality. I personally know some finest woman coders, who work on edge
technologies. 

But the
problem is they step back and underestimate themselves. If kalpana Chawla can
be an astronaut why can’t another woman be a good coder. It’s just that we need
to be bold and fearless. When I was in college, boys in my class used to talk
about some new technologies that I never heard about, even I used to feel that
I am nowhere in front of them. But when I gave coding test in scholarship exam
for INSOFE, I actually scored better than all others irrespective of gender. It’s
just a matter of practice and being up to date.

 

Q) What according to you are the challenges women in tech face
today? 

Challenges
are more because of some unavoidable bias , for example my MD mentioned in one
of her speeches that when she visited another country and a colleague was
introducing to a client that meet my boss and the client looked at another
colleague who is a male. So this un conscious  bias brings down the morale.

Another challenge
is that when ladies take a break for marriage or kids they come back and take
support roles, they feel that they should not take critical work, since they
have lost the track.

Also they might
fell that they are left behind in race, since they took a break.

It’s not a
race with someone else, it’s a race where you are competing with yourself to
become better every day. No one is late or behind, we all are running in our
own time zones.

 

Q) How do you keep yourself up to date with
technological changes in your field?

I read blogs
like Techcrunch, TheInformation  to stay
up to date. Few of my favorite websites are crazyforcode and geeksforgeeks for
coding and Analytics Vidhya newsletter for analytics. I get email feeds related
to my field from websites like Quora.

I am part of
many active forums in my organization as well. In my leisure time I listen to
ted ed talks as well.

And to stay on track
I take part in technical events like hackathons in and outside my organization. 

 

Q) What keeps you driven?

There is
beautiful line said by Doctor Abdul Kalam Sir-“Dream is not what you see in
sleep, is the thing that does not let you sleep”. My dream of making my parents
proud does not let me sleep. I believe in trying and doing my best, rest is in
God’s hands.

 

Q) Anything else you would like to add?

I strongly believe
that there is no shortcut for long term success. We might get small success by
short cuts and tricks, but the taste of success after long hard work is beyond
anything. Neither we should ignore our personal life and specially our parents,
nor we should lose track of our work life, we need to have a good balance of
both. A good work life supports a good personal life and vice versa One final
thing I would like to add is never underestimate yourself, grab every
opportunity coming, you never know what you are capable of. 

 

Please share your solo high res pictures along
with the response.

 

Best,
